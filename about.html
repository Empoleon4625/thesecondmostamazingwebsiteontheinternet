<h3><font color="#FF0000">How does this relate to the Topic?</font></h3>
<h3><font color="#00FFFF" size="-1">To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand our website. The theme is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of memeology most of the jokes will go 

over a typical user's head. There's also our subtle jokes, which is deftly woven into our website - our jokes draw heavily from early meme literature, for instance. Our 

friends understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something 

deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike our work truly ARE normies- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the Spooky Skeleton's 

existencial catchphrase "Get Spook'd" which itself is a cryptic reference to Spooky Scary Skeletons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated 

simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as our group's genius unfolds itself on their monitors. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Pepe 

tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the memers' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) 

beforehand.</font></h3>
